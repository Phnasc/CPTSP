The project involves various steps, including data preprocessing, visualization, and geographical analysis. The aim is to gain insights into theft-related crimes and their distribution across different areas.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze crime occurrence data from São Paulo and gain insights into theft-related crimes. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Initially, the dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and contents. The columns are analyzed to identify relevant features for the analysis.

3. **Visualization:** The dataset is visualized using line plots and bar plots to understand the monthly evolution of crime occurrences. Percentage differences between consecutive months are also displayed.

4. **Geographical Analysis:** Geographical analysis involves mapping crime occurrences across São Paulo. Hexagonal grids are used to visualize the distribution of theft-related crimes.
